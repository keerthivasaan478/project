## **Project Brief: Automated Fleet Maintenance System**

### **1. Executive Summary**

This project will create an Automated Fleet Maintenance Management System for a logistics company. The system will solve the problem of inefficient, manual maintenance scheduling by automatically generating and assigning tasks to technicians. Its core value proposition is to increase fleet uptime, improve operational visibility, and reduce administrative overhead through a modern, web-based platform.

### **2. Problem Statement**

The current fleet maintenance process is manual, relying on spreadsheets and manual tracking. This leads to several critical business problems:
*   **Missed Services:** Vehicles frequently miss scheduled maintenance due to human error, increasing the risk of costly breakdowns and reducing fleet availability.
*   **Inefficient Scheduling:** There is no intelligent system for assigning tasks, resulting in unbalanced workloads where some technicians are overburdened while others are underutilized.
*   **Lack of Visibility:** Management has no real-time insight into maintenance status, technician performance, or the quality of completed work.
*   **Poor Data Quality:** Maintenance records are inconsistent, incomplete, or difficult to access, making it impossible to track trends or manage parts inventory effectively.

### **3. Proposed Solution**

We propose a web-based application that automates the entire maintenance lifecycle. The system will feature:
*   A centralized **Vehicle Fleet Database** serving as the single source of truth.
*   An **Automated Task Generation Engine** that creates monthly maintenance schedules based on pre-defined service intervals.
*   A **Smart Task Assignment Algorithm** that distributes work to technicians based on location, availability, and workload.
*   A **Technician-focused Mobile Interface** for viewing tasks and submitting detailed completion reports, including photo evidence and parts usage.
*   A **Manager Dashboard** providing real-time, actionable insights into fleet health and maintenance operations.

### **4. Target Users**

*   **Primary User: The Maintenance Technician**
    *   **Role:** Performs hands-on maintenance for the vehicle fleet.
    *   **Needs:** A simple, fast, and reliable way to see their assigned jobs and report their work. Must be easy to use on a tablet in a garage environment.
    *   **Pain Points:** Unclear priorities, cumbersome paperwork, losing track of parts used.

*   **Secondary User: The Fleet Manager**
    *   **Role:** Oversees the maintenance operations and fleet readiness.
    *   **Needs:** A high-level, real-time view of the entire operation to quickly identify problems (overdue tasks, technician capacity) and verify work quality.
    *   **Pain Points:** Lack of data for decision-making, inability to track team performance, uncertainty about fleet health.

### **5. Goals & Success Metrics**

*   **Business Objectives:**
    *   Reduce the number of overdue maintenance tasks by 90% within 3 months of launch.
    *   Improve fleet operational uptime by 15% within 6 months.
*   **User Success Metrics:**
    *   Reduce the time it takes for a technician to document a completed task by 75%.
    *   Enable managers to get a full fleet maintenance status overview in under 60 seconds.
*   **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
    *   Percentage of maintenance tasks completed on time.
    *   Average number of active tasks per technician (workload distribution).
    *   Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) for fleet vehicles.

### **6. MVP Scope**

#### **Core Features (Must Have)**

1.  A pre-populated database of vehicles and technicians.
2.  A one-click function for managers to generate the entire upcoming month's maintenance tasks.
3.  Automated assignment of all generated tasks based on location, availability, and workload.
4.  A mobile-friendly view for technicians to see their assigned tasks and submit a completion form with required photos, parts list, and signature.
5.  A dashboard for managers to view overdue tasks, technician workload, and a gallery of recently completed work.

#### **Out of Scope for MVP**

*   A user-facing admin interface for adding/editing vehicles, technicians, or parts (this will be done directly in the database for the MVP).
*   A full parts inventory management system.
*   Predictive maintenance based on mileage or fault codes.
*   Historical reporting and trend analysis.
*   Native iOS or Android applications.

### **7. Post-MVP Vision**

*   **Phase 2:** Introduce a full inventory management module and historical reporting to track performance over time.
*   **Long-term Vision:** Evolve the system into a predictive maintenance platform, using mileage data and historical faults to predict and schedule maintenance *before* it's needed, further increasing fleet uptime.

### **8. Technical Considerations**

*   **Platform Requirements:** The system must be a web-responsive application, fully functional on both desktop and modern tablets/smartphones.
*   **Technology Preferences:** A modern, serverless, TypeScript-based stack is preferred for scalability and maintainability (e.g., Next.js frontend, AWS Lambda backend).
*   **Architecture Considerations:** A monorepo structure is recommended to streamline development. The system should be designed with a robust API to support future integrations.

### **9. Risks & Open Questions**

*   **Key Risks:**
    *   **Technician Adoption:** The success of the project hinges on technicians consistently using the new tool. The mobile UX must be exceptionally simple and reliable.
    *   **Data Integrity:** The initial data for vehicles and service intervals must be accurate for the automation to work correctly.
*   **Open Questions:**
    *   What are the exact service intervals for all vehicle types?
    *   What is the complete list of parts to be pre-populated for the maintenance forms?
